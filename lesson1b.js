// In javascript we need to have an inicializer before declairing a value. In ES6 we have two main types of initializers i.e:

// Let : Declaires values that can be changed later on.

let weight = 10.5

console.log(weight)

// const : It is used to declaire variables which contains values that cannot be changes in the entire program.

const pi = 3.142
console.log("The pi is: ", pi)
